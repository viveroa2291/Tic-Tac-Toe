# Tic Tac Toe
Experience a classic game of Tic Taco Toe through this web application that I built. It supports both a single and two-player mode and includes features such as entering names and keeping score.

My learning was focused on making a simple UI and a smooth UX that resembles a tic tac toe board. 

# Optimizations

I would like to improve this board by providing more designs and adding more features.
<ul>
 <li>I would like to improve the single player on creating 3 difficulty levels and expand more from there. </li>
 <li>Fix some bugs in the game</li>
 <li>Enhance the mobile experience as it is very buggy.</li>
 <li>Cleanup the code and create a more short and dynamic code.</li>
</ul>

# Lessons Learned:

<ul>
 <li>Creating the single player mode by adding a random functionality.</li>
</ul>
